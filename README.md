# Discord Temporary Voice Channels

This library works the same way its parent does (see [discord-temp-channels](https://github.com/Androz2091/discord-temp-channels) of [Androz2091](https://github.com/Androz2091)) except that it brings a few new features:

- create/delete a temporary text channel via an event
- more events like `voiceChannelCreate`, `textChannelCreate` and **4 more**
- give the temporary channels' owner the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission on them
- give more permissions to users/roles when channels are created (via registered parent options)
- auto-prefix renamed temporary channels if the prefix is missing
- reload temporary channels in memory in case the bot restarts while the feature is being used
- Source code embedded documentation with [JSDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc)

## Prerequisites ⚠️

Starting at **v2.0.0**, you must use **NodeJS v16.6.0 or higher** to run a bot with this library.

You also must not forget to include [mandatory intents](#mandatory-intents) as well as give your bot the rights to [use application commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#authorizing-your-application).

### Mandatory intents

- GUILD_VOICE_STATE: used to detect guild members voice state updates (when someone joins a voice channel, leaves or changes from one to another, ...).
- GUILDS: used to recover from possible crashes of your bot (detects and reconstructs the temporary channels list and deletes them if necessary).

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save @hunteroi/discord-temp-channels
```

## Examples

See [./example/withTempChannelsManager.js](example/withTempChannelsManager.js) and [./example/withClientWithTempManager.js](example/withClientWithTempManager.js).

<br />

⚠️ Please be aware that using slash commands in temporary text channels might raise exceptions in your event listeners. We highly suggest that you wrap your listeners' code in a try-catch block (or use the then/catch chaining methods of the `Promise` class in case you don't apply the async/await pattern).

For exemple, if you try to execute `interaction.editReply` after the interaction's channel has been deleted, you will receive an error in your console.

## Events

```ts
manager.on(
	TempChannelsManagerEvents.channelRegister,
	(parent: ParentChannelData) => {}
);

manager.on(
	TempChannelsManagerEvents.channelUnregister,
	(parent: ParentChannelData) => {}
);

manager.on(
	TempChannelsManagerEvents.voiceChannelCreate,
	(voiceChannel: VoiceChannel) => {}
);

manager.on(
	TempChannelsManagerEvents.voiceChannelDelete,
	(voiceChannel: VoiceChannel) => {}
);

manager.on(
	TempChannelsManagerEvents.voiceNotExisting,
	(interaction: Interaction) => {}
);

manager.on(
	TempChannelsManagerEvents.textChannelCreate,
	(textChannel: TextChannel, interaction: Interaction | undefined) => {}
);

manager.on(
	TempChannelsManagerEvents.textChannelDelete,
	(textChannel: TextChannel, interaction: Interaction | undefined) => {}
);

manager.on(
	TempChannelsManagerEvents.childPrefixChange,
	(channel: GuildChannel) => {}
);

manager.on(
	TempChannelsManagerEvents.childCreate,
	(
		member: GuildMember | ClientUser,
		child: ChildChannelData,
		parent: ParentChannelData
	) => {}
);

manager.on(
	TempChannelsManagerEvents.childDelete,
	(
		member: GuildMember | ClientUser,
		child: ChildChannelData,
		parent: ParentChannelData
	) => {}
);

manager.on(
	TempChannelsManagerEvents.error,
	(error: Error, message: string) => {}
);
```

## Commands

In order to trigger the creation/deletion of a text channel, please emit the `TempChannelsManagerEvents.createText` event using your instance of the `TempChannelsManager` class and pass it the interaction object:

```ts
client.on('interactionCreate', async (interaction) => {
	if (interaction.isCommand() && interaction.commandName === 'createtext') {
		await interaction.deferReply();
		client.tempChannelsManager.emit(
			TempChannelsManagerEvents.createText,
			interaction
		);
	}
});
```

Even though we do not provide an example, this works the same way for the `messageCreate` event.
